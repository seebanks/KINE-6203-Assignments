% There are two parts to this assignment. Part 1 deals with using the
% Matlab documentation to answer some questions or perform some tasks. Part
% 2 involves you writing your very first Matlab program!!

% Please write all of your responses in the following .mfile.
% If there are comments after the question (as in question 2) please 
% write your answer inside those comments. If there are not comments
% please write your answer with correct matlab syntax. 
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Part 1  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 1. Set the url of the matlab documentation to a variable called helpURL

helpURL = 'https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ ';

% 2. What does the command 'clear all' do?
%
% Answer: The "Clear All" command clears all of the variables in the
% current workspace.
%matlab


% 3. Find a matlab function to take the average of the following
% numbers [1 7 21 32 67 32453]? Store your answer in a variable called
% averageAnswer.

Q3numbers = [1, 7, 21, 32, 67, 32453];
averageAnswer = mean(Q3numbers);

% 4. What command would you type to see a list of all installed toolboxes?

        %<- ver

% 5. Write some commands that would return a list of all of the available 
% functions in the image processing toolbox? 
 
    help images

% 6. On the line below figure, write a command to draw a graph of 
% x and y. 

x = linspace(-2*pi,2*pi);
y = sin(x);

figure
        %<- plot(x,y)


% 7. Find a function that performs a statistical test you've seen used
% in a journal article (there are many possible answers to this). What does
% this function do and how would you use it?

%
% Answer: [p,tbl,stats] = anova1(your data set)
% The statistical test I chose is an ANOVA test. An ANOVA test is used when
% a researcher wants to test for differences in the mean of more than two
% samples by examining variation of the individual samples relative to the amount
% of variation there is between the samples. This test could help determine
% if there are any statistically significant differences between the 
% sample means of independent groups.
% This function creates a table from a linear regression model of 
% the data set as well as a box plot of the data set.
% 

% 8. What are the 2 major types of loops that MATLAB supports? What is the
% difference between them?

%
% Answer: Matlab supports a "for loop" and a "while loop". A 'for' loop is
% used to repeat a loop a specified number of times, and it keeps track of
% each iteration with incrementing index variables. A 'while' statement
% continues to loop only as long as the condition remains true. 
% 


% 9. What does NaN stand for? Give an example of when you would get NaN as
% an answer. 

%
% Answer: NaN stands for "Not a Number'. This acronym would show up if you
% have a complex number or a not real number; for example if you were to
% try and divide 0 by 0. 
%


% 10. The following code snippet executes but contains an error (we don't
% get a useful answer). See if you can use the documentation to fix the 
% error to get the sum of the numbers in A. Do not change or remove 
% any of the values in A.

A = [1 2 3 2 1 NaN 1 2 3 NaN];
S = sum(A, 'omitnan');


% 11. I used to love playing the game minesweeper. Is there a way that I
% could play a similar game on Matlab? Write the command that would launch
% the game if so. 

xpbombs
    %Found this command by using ChatGPT to help me reveal how to play
    %minesweeper on matlab. This command opens an "easter egg" that runs a
    %minesweeper style game for the user to play.

% 12. Create a variable myAge and assign it the value of your age. Then 
% create a new variable called ageLessTwo and subtract two from the value of the
% myAge variable. Create a third variable called agePlusOne and add one to 
% the value of the myAge variable.
myAge = 21;
ageLessTwo = myAge - 2;
agePlusOne = myAge + 1;


% 13. Use the built-in function namelengthmax to find out the maximum number of
% characters that you can have in an identifier name under your version of
% MATLAB. Assign the value to a variable called maxNameLength.
maxNameLength = (namelengthmax);

%My specific version has a max character limit of 63


% 14. You need to convert some weight values from metric to standard units. 
% Create two appropriately named variables to store the original weight in 
% pounds and the original weight in ounces respectively. Use who and whos 
% to see the variables. Clear one of your variables and then use who and whos again.

originalWeightkg = 100;
% Add your code on the next line

Q14WeightPounds = originalWeightkg*2.20462;
Q14WeightOunces = originalWeightkg*35.274;



% 15. Assign a number with a decimal place to an appropriately named variable. Convert the
% variable to the type int32 and store the result in a new variable (hint: this is known
% as casting in computer programming). Use whos to check your result. 
Q15Decimal = 24.7;
Q15NewDecimal = int32(Q15Decimal);
whos


% 16. Create a variable called weightInLBs to store a weight in pounds. Convert this to 
% kilograms using an appropriate calculation or function and assign the result to a variable weightInKgs.
weightInLBs = 136;
weightInKgs = weightInLBs/2.20462;



% 18. Create a variable fTemp to store a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (F). 
% Convert this to degrees Celsius (C) using an appropriate 
% calculation and store the result in a variable cTemp.
fTemp = 85.9;
cTemp = (fTemp - 32)* (5/9);



% 19. Using the colon operator, create the following row vectors:
% 2 3 4 5 6 7 
% 1.1000 1.3000 1.5000 1.7000 
% 8 6 4 2
% Store your results with variable names vecA, vecB and vecC respectively.

vecA = (2:7);
vecB = (1.1:0.2:1.7);
vecC = (8:-2:2);


% 20. Give a MATLAB expression that would create a vector 
% (assigned to a variable called vec) of 50 elements that range, equally spaced, 
% from 0 to 2pi. 
vec = linspace(0, 2*pi, 50);



% 21. Using the colon operator and the transpose operator, 
% create a column vector that has the values -1 to 1 in steps of 0.5.
% Assign your answer to a variable called colVec.

Q21 = (-1:0.5:1);
colVec = transpose(Q21);


% 22. Create a variable called rows that is a random integer in the inclusive range 
% from 1 to 5. Create a variable called cols that is a random integer in the 
% inclusive range from 1 to 5. Create a matrix called resultMat of all zeros with the 
% dimensions given by the values of rows and cols. The resultMat should
% change each time you execute your code. 
rows = randi([1, 5],1);
cols = randi([1, 5],1);
resultMat = zeros(rows, cols);


% 23. Create a vector of five random integers, each in the inclusive range 
% from -10 to 10 assigned to a variable named originalVec. Perform each of 
% the following on the original vector and store your results in appropriately 
% named variables. (you should have a seperate line of code for each)
originalVec = randi([-10,10], 1, 5);

% - subtract 3 from each element
orginalVecSub3 = originalVec - 3;

% - count how many are positive
originalVecPositiveNum = sum(originalVec>0);

% - get the absolute value of each element
originalVecABsoluteVal = abs(originalVec);

% - find the maximum.
originalVecMaxVal = max(originalVec);


% 24. Write some code that will calculate the area of a trapezoid. Create
% variables for base1, base2, and height and assign them values. Store the
% result of your calculation in a variable called trapArea. Comment your
% code so that another user can understand what your code does. 

trapB1 = randi([1,20], 1);
trapB2 = randi([1,20], 1);
trapH = randi([1,20], 1);

trapArea = ((trapB1+trapB2)/2)*trapH;

%The area of a trapezoid is Area =((length of base 1 + length of base 2)/2)*height. In this
%problem, the variables for base 1, base 2 and trapezoid height are trapB1,
%trapB2 and trapH respectively. Each variable has been assigned a random
%variable (randi) to generate between the numbers 1-20 each time the code is run.
%The area of your trapizoid can be found under the variable named
%'trapArea'.


% 25. If you were to start your own lab/business, a key metric that you 
% might use is ROI when applying for a business loan or making organizational 
% decisions. The classic equation for ROI is:

% ROI = (Total Revenues â€“ Total Costs) / Total Costs x 100

% Write some code that prompts the user to input total revenues and total 
% costs and then calculates the ROI and stores the value in a variable called
% ROI.

prompt = "What is your Total Revenues?";
TRevenue = input(prompt);
 
prompt2 = "What are your total cost?";
TCost = input(prompt2);

ROI = ((TRevenue - TCost)/TCost)*100;


%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Part 2: Hello World %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Write some code that will print the string 'Hello World' to the screen. 
% There are several ways that you could do this. For an extra challenge, 
% make your program able to take text input from the user and output 
% whatever they input. (For ease of running and executing your solution for 
% part 2, make sure you click the Run Section button vs the Run button) 

%%% Enter the code for your program below this line

fprintf('Hello World')

msgbox('Hello World') %this code will have a 'pop-up' message box on the screen



%%%%% When you have completed everything, type the following two commands
%%%%% (without comments) into your command window. 

%%% load handel
%%% sound(y, Fs)
